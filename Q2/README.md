# Test Q2

Solution is in Java in which a method compareVersions is defined that takes two version strings as input and compares them. The comparison is done by splitting the input strings into components (numbers separated by dots) and comparing corresponding components. The components are parsed as integers, and the method returns "Greater" if the first version is greater, "Less" if the first version is smaller, and "Equal" if both versions are equal.
In the main method, several test cases are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the compareVersions method with different input scenarios.

To use the program via the console, follow these steps after you have compiled the Test_Q2.java file:

Open Command Prompt or Terminal:

- Open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) on your system.
- Navigate to the Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you saved the compiled .class file.
- Run the Java Program: Run the Java program using the java command followed by the class name without the .class extension. In this case, the class name is Test_Q2.
- View the Output: Press Enter after entering the command. The program will execute the main method in the Test_Q2 class, and you will see the output directly in the console.

The output displayed in the console, showa the comparison results for the test cases specified in the main method.
Any changes or new test cases you want to try can be modified directly in the main method of the Test_Q2 class in the Test_Q2.java file. After making changes, you need to recompile the Java file using javac Test_Q2.java and then run the program again using java Test_Q2.
