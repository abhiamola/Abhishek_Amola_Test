# Test Q1

Program is written in Java and hecks if two lines, represented by their coordinates, overlap or not. It achieves this by defining a method doLinesOverlap that takes two arrays of integers, each containing two coordinates for a line. Inside this method, it checks if the lines overlap by comparing the x-coordinates. The main method of the program prompts the user to enter coordinates for two lines, calls the doLinesOverlap method, and prints true if the lines overlap and false otherwise.

To use the provided Java program via the console, follow these steps:

Compile the Java Program:
First, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Save the Java code into a file, for example, Test_Q1.java.
- Open a command prompt or terminal window.
- Navigate to the directory where Test_Q1.java is saved using the cd command (e.g., cd path/to/your/java/file).
- Compile the Java file by typing: javac Test_Q1.java
- This will compile the Java source code and create a Test_Q1.class file.

Run the Program:
After compiling successfully, run the program with the following command: java Test_Q1
- This will execute the program and the console will display: Enter coordinates of first line (Separated by a space):
- Enter the coordinates for the first line, separated by a space (for example, 1 5) and press Enter.
- The console will then display: Enter coordinates of second line (Separated by a space):
- Enter the coordinates for the second line, separated by a space (for example, 3 7) and press Enter.

View the Output:
- The program will calculate if the lines represented by the entered coordinates overlap or not.
- The output, either true (if lines overlap) or false (if lines do not overlap), will be displayed on the console.

For example, if you enter 1 5 as coordinates for the first line and 3 7 for the second line, the program will output true because the lines overlap.
